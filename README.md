# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

### Description of Project

I used Html and Css to create the project at hand. The project is a website intended for profile setup as well as being able to upload and view pictures per your profile. It is intended to be able to be viewed on multiple screen resolutions and fits the screen differently the smaller/bigger it gets. To achieve this I used a media query.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
